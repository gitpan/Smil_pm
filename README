WHAT IS THIS?

The Smil.pm module.  This module provides an interface for generating 
SMIL files using perl.  SMIL is a W3C langauge for multi-media authoring.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

Use the makefile.  Run this command

perl Makefile.PL

If you have the privileges, perl will place it in the right spot.

If you are not administrator, or have insufficient privileges to install
into the perl lib path, then you will have to modify your %INC variable 
using this command (substitute the directory where Smil.pm is for 
the fake directory /install/path/)

use lib '/install/path/';
use SYMM::Smil;

OR

BEGIN { unshift @INC, '/install/path/'; }

Either one of these commands will allow you to use the module, provided
you fill in the correct path for '/install/path/'

WHAT SYSTEMS DOES IT WORK WITH?

I have tested it on several Linux distributions and ActiveState Perl for
Win32.  The module is pure perl, so it should work with any standard
perl distribution.  If it doesn't, please email me and tell me your problem.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

Run 'perldoc SYMM::Smil'  If you haven't installed it correctly, you will 
have to perpend the installation directory to the front of the module
name.

WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?

I have provided a few examples within the perldoc documentation.  It is 
a top priority for me to add these to the web page for perlysmil, which 
is here:

I'll try to add more to this soon.

Hope this helps you with MM authoring.
